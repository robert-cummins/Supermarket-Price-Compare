# Supermarket Price Compare

Supermarket Price Compare compares the cost of a single item or whole shopping list at New Zealand's largest supermarket chains (New World, Countdown and PaknSave). I built this App so families or individuals can make informed financial decisions on where to shop and to budget correctly as the user will be informed exactly how much their shopping list will cost.


## Instructions

* Search for items on your shopping list, e.g., "beef mince" using the search bar. Results will be shown for all 3 supermarkets under the "Search Results" tab.
* If you would like to see the total cost of multiple items at a supermarket, use the "add item" button to keep track.
* Add the same items at each supermarket if you would like to compare total prices between them.
* Large search results can be narrowed using the category checkboxes. Being as specific as possible with your search, e.g., searching the brand name as well as the product name or adding the word "produce" when searching for fresh vegatables, e.g., "produce carrots" will also help narrow search results.
* Click on the "shopping basket" tab at any time to see the total running cost for each supermarket.
